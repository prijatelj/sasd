Sprint 1

To add the hint editor to a webpage, one must add some click-able element with the onclick attribute set to "toggleHintEditor()" and an empty div with id "hintEditor", as well as adding the HintEditor.js as an external script in the head of the html.

Once the element with the onclick attribute is clicked, a textbox and save button will appear inside the empty div with id="hintEditor". User may enter text and click the save button. Their input is then saved as a global JS var named "hintInput" which will be used for translation into PG code.
