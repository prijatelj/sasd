System Analysis and Software Design (Software Engineering)
=
SASD is a Duquesne computer science course (COSC 445W) where we learn about software design. Our program assignments were all designed to mimic real world software production pipelines. Our class semster project is to improve the GUI of WeBWorK for it to be more user friendly to those with no programming experience.

This serves as a repository of my personal contributions to the project.
